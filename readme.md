<h1>WordPress Course Project</h2>

<p>This is a project I completed that taught me how to create custom dynamic Wordpress websites with PHP. I learned how to setup the custom project, and then learned how to utilize things like custom post types and advanced custom fields to make the site dynamic and easily updated through the CMS.</p>
